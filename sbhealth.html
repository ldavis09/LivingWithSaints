<div class="ortho">
<h3 style="color:#ddd; text-align:center;">Hip dysplasia</h3>
  <p class="pb-2">Hip dysplasia occurs when the hip joint is not properly formed, causing the head of the femur to rub against the acetabulum (the socket that the femoral head fits into) which eventually leads to arthritis in the joint and causes a lot of pain. It's a common issue in giant breed dogs, but when Odin was 5 months old, he was diagnosed with severe bilateral hip dysplasia. I knew that it was a common issue in Saint Bernards, I just hadn't anticipated in being an issue at such a young age. There are currently 4 surgical options for the treatment of hip dysplasia. Odin ended up having to have what's called a double pelvic osteotomy (DPO) which basically means that the surgeon had to go in and break his hip in two places and form the acetabulum using plates and screws at 6 months old to correct the worst of the two hips and ensure that he'd still be able to walk by the time he was fully grown. Thankfully, Odin recovered well. He is now 4 years old and has not had any issues from his hip dysplasia, aside from the fact that he will have a slightly odd walk and one of his rear paws often turns out slightly.</p>
  <h3 style="color: #ddd; text-align:center;">Elbow dysplasia</h3>
  <p class="pb-2">Elbow dysplasia, is similar to hip dysplasia, however, it occurs when the elbow joint is malformed. There are 5 variations of elbow dysplasia. They are Ununited anconeal process (UAP), Fragmented medial coronoid process (FMCP), Osteochondritis dissecans of the medial humeral condyle (OCD), Ununited medial epicondyle (UME), and Elbow incongruity. All variations are ultimately the result of the elbow joint forming incorrectly, and all will inevitably result in arthritis in the elbow joint. Depending on the severity of disease, treatment involves either surgical intervention or medication to manage pain and inflammation.</p>
   <h3 style="color: #ddd; text-align: center;">Osteosarcoma</h3>
  <p>Osteosarcoma is cancer of the bones, and it is often seen in middle aged giant breed dogs, including Saint Bernard’s. Early detection is crucial, as it is typically an aggressive cancer, meaning it can spread rapidly. If caught early enough, it is sometimes possible to remove the tumor before it spreads. The earliest symptoms include leg pain, or refusal to put weight on a leg, so if you notice your dog limping, it is important to seek veterinary care as soon as possible.</p>

  <div class = "eyes">
<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #ddd">Entropion &amp; Ectropion</h3>
            <p class="pb-2">Entropion is when the either the upper or lower eyelids roll inwards. This results in irritation of the cornea as the eyelashes and hair rub against it, causing abrasions of the cornea. If surgical intervention is not performed, entropion will eventually lead to corneal ulcers, which are severely painful. Corneal ulcers, besides being painful, can also impair the vision, and can ultimately lead to the need to remove the eye. Ectropion is when the eyelids roll outwards. It can lead to conjunctivitis. If the surface of the eye dries out, the cornea becomes inflamed. Scarring, and impaired vision are also possible. Ectropion can be corrected surgically, however, surgery is typically reserved for severe cases. Mild to moderate cases can be medically managed, just be aware that it is a life-long condition.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #ddd;">Cherry Eye</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">Cherry eye is when the third eyelid (called the nictitating membrane), which houses a tear gland, becomes visible. The connective tissue becomes lose, allowing the tear gland to hang down. It appears as a red, round mass in the corner of the eye, which is were the name "Cherry eye" stems from. Surgical intervention is generally required as it can lead to conjunctivitis, and irritation if the dog is pawing at the protrusion. Even after surgery, cherry eye can recur, meaning that they may have to have the surgery more than once.</p>

           <h3 style="text-align: center;">GASTRIC DILATATION AND VOLVULUS</h3>
            <p>Gastric Dilatation and Volvulus (GDV) is one of the most important veterinary emergencies Saint Bernard owners should familiarize themselves with, as Saint Bernard’s and other large, barrel chested breeds are most effected. It happens when gas gets trapped in the stomach (known as bloat), which then causes the stomach to flip over inside the abdomen, cutting off the blood supply to the stomach and in some cases, other organs can be involved and have their blood supply cut off as well. I’ve seen it first hard in my old German Shepherd and while fortunately, we were able to save him, it’s only because I had previously researched what to look for and knew the signs and importance of rushing him to the closest emergency veterinarian. Dogs experiencing bloat will become restless, often pacing around, panting, and eventually trying to vomit or vomiting foam. They decline <em>very</em> rapidly, and if surgical intervention does not happen fast enough, they will die. I plan to have Odin’s stomach tacked (a procedure known as a preventative gastropexy) to hopefully avoid his stomach ever being able to flip.</p>
